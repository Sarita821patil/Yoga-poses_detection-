# Yoga Pose Detection & Correction

## Description
This project demonstrates an AI-powered yoga pose detection and correction system using MediaPipe. 
It identifies yoga poses through a webcam feed and provides visual feedback for alignment.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python yoga_pose_detection.py
   ```

## Dataset
The `sample_dataset.csv` provides a basic example of annotated yoga pose data.

## Future Work
- Add more poses and corrective feedback logic.
- Integrate into a mobile app for enhanced accessibility.
